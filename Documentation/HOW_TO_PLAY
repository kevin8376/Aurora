#HOW TO PLAY
YOU WILL BE PROVIDED WITH 8 TROOPS AND 4 SPELLS AND ___ UPGRADE OPTIONS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO USE TO DESTROY THE SOLAR SYSTEM IN ORDER TO FINISH THE GAME

#THE CONCEPT OF CP'S
CP'S ARE THE CURRENCY OF THE GAME AND CAN BE USED FOR THE FOLLOWING 
- DEPLOY TROOPS
- CAST SPELLS
- MAKE UPGRADES TO THE DEPLOYED TROOPS

THE COST OF THE NEW TROOPS WILL BE MORE THAT THAT OF THE BEGINNING ONE'S AND THE COST OF UPGRADES WILL ALSO INCREASE WITH EVERY SUCCESSIVE UPGRADE.

  
#HOW TO DESTROY THE SOLAR SYSTEM
IN THE BEGINNING YOU WILL ONLY HAVE A SINGLE TYPE OF TROOP AND A SINGLE PLANET UNLOCKED AFTER DESTROYING THE FIRST PLANET 
COMPLETELY THE SECOND PLANET WILL BE UNLOCKED ALONG WITH THE SECOND TROOP AND AFTER DESTROYING THE SECOND PLANET COMPLETELY
YOU WILL UNLOCK THE THIRD PLANET AND THIRD TROOP AND SO ON. ALL THE PREVIOUS TROOPS WILL REMAIN UNLOCKED AND THEY CAN ALSO BE
USED TO ATTACK NEWLY UNLOCKED PLANETS BUT WONT BE THAT EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT. LIKE THIS YOU CAN DESTROY THE ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM
