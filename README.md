# Overview
--> we are planning to prepare a game
1. What is this game about? --> First of all we will be playing as a villain and we are the dark forces who want to conquer the universe. We get a chance to conquer our solar system and this will be a level by level process.
2. How to play?--> we will have an army which will be limited in the starting and can be purchased using the currency points about which we will elaborate later, and as the level is being completed you can unlock the next without completing the first one completely but it will keep running so you will have to destroy that starting planet completely to win the game. Going further you can level up your troops also using currency points and you can unlock certain abilities later in the game and gradually the difficulty of the level will also increase.
3. The concept of currency points --> they can be used in the shop of the game. Now how to gain the currency points? Its simple you will find a symbol dedicated to the currency points on your screen periodically clicking on them will add up a small amount of these currency points. You will also get these points after destroying a planet completely.
4. After completion of the game you will unlock some additional content like themes and skins, and if you wish to replay the game you can do so but it will start from scratch and the difficulty will rise from the starting itself and will be increasing significantly with the number of times you play the game.
