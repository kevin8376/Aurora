#HOW TO DESTROY THE SOLAR SYSTEM
You will start with an army of ____ and the army will be automated and will be distributed to each planet in required amounts. Some CPs will also be given to you in the starting of the game which you can use to enhance your army. There will be a timer running in the game and for every 1m:30s you will get some amount of CP's and some reinforcements. CP's can not only be used for enhancing your army but also can be used to call in reinforcements before the time but this will reduce the amount of reinforcements which you will get after the time period. Your score will depend on the time you take to finish the game so make sure you finish it as soon as possible because THE CLOCK IS TICKING!
